# Scientific Calculator
We all use scientific calculator in our day to day life as a college student you have to carry with you.
So, here i come with solution that create a virtual scientific calculator using javascript. To make this
Project challenging and intresting we have not use eval() of javascipt.

### Installation
  
  - How to clone?
    - **Step:1** To clone this project in your local device use Following command in your command line interface.But make
      sure you are in correct folder.
      
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/vipulc8/Scientific_Calculator.git
      ```
      - Note: Not to use square bracket it just for understanding purpose.
      
    - **Step:2** After clone the project in local pc move to that directory use following command.
      
      ```
      cd Scientific_Calculator/
      ```
    - now you can open this code in any Code editor.
    
  - Or if you don't want to use command like just click on download button.Refer the screenshot below:
        ![](https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Download%20From%20GitHub%20A%20Beginners%20Guide.png?width=450&height=306&name=How%20to%20Download%20From%20GitHub%20A%20Beginners%20Guide.png)

  - Now to see the code use any code editor. I prefer Vs Code but user editor in which you are comfortable.
    * Vs Code (version 1.75 ) [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    * Chrome Browser [Download](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/chrome/)
    
  - Use live server in vs code to see in Browser. If you does not have liver server in vs code go to extention and search for live server and install it. After you see as show in scrrenshot.

### Technologies & Tools

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript.
- Bootstrap (version 5.3) [Link](https://getbootstrap.com/) 

### Feature

- ### Memory Storage
  - You can store value and then do operation on it and Recall. 
    - MS button use for store value in local storage.
    - M+ and M- use to add value and subtract on local storage value.
    - MR Memeroy recall.
    - Mc After you use is done you can clear you local storage.
    
- ### Trigonometry Operation
  - To find value of **sin,con,tan** and many more.
  - To use Inverse click on **"2nd"** button and for hyperbolic function click **"hyp"** button.
  - If you want ous sinh inverse first click on 2nd button and then click on **"hyp"** button so you will get.
  - For Unit change just click on **"DEG"** it and set as per you requirement.
  - You Minght get confuse in sin invers and sin h inverse display on screen.
      - **"sinin" = "sin^-1"**
      - **"sinhin" = "sinh^-1"**
  ### Flow of Trigonometry:
  - First click button then type the degree/radina/grad value and then click **"="** button.
  

- ### Function 
  - |x| use for modlus of value.
  - ⎣x⎦ find floor value example: 2.3 it will give 2
  - ⎡x⎤ find ceil value example: 2.3  it will give 3
  - rand if your input is empty it will generate random number between 0,1 and else if you input number it will go in that range.
  - dms this function convert degree to degree: minutes:second.
  - deg will convert you input into degress
  
 - ###  Way to use some Operation
   - In **"square root" , "cube root","x^3" and "x^2"**  you have first type the number and then click on operation button but you will see there is no answer on screen hmmm wait just click on "=" button and there you go you will get you answer.
   
      - **step:1** Enter the number.
      - **step:2** Click on "squar root " / "cube root" / "x^2/ "x^3".
      - **step:3** Then Click on "=" for answer.
    
   - For **"10^x","log","ln","1/x","2^x","e^x","n!"** here you have to first click on button and then enter the number. For answer click on "=" button.
   
   - In **"logyx"** you have pass the base and then click on "logyx" and then enter value don't forget to click on "=" for answer. Similar in "y root x" button.
   
   
   - Now for last arithmetic function use can use bracket,"e" and "pi" in side the expression it will solve the expression just remember to click "=" for answer.
